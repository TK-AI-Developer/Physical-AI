# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Clarity
A core goal is to provide educational clarity for readers, progressing from beginner to advanced topics in a structured manner. All content must be presented in a way that is accessible and builds upon previous concepts. Rationale: To make complex topics in AI and robotics understandable to a wide audience.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All technical information, including concepts related to AI, robotics, and cloud-native technologies, must be accurate and up-to-date. Code examples must be correct and functional. Rationale: To ensure the book is a reliable and trustworthy resource for learning.

### III. Practical Outcomes
The book must focus on practical, hands-on examples that allow readers to build real systems. Each chapter and module should guide the reader towards a tangible outcome. Rationale: To provide readers with practical skills and experience.

### IV. Ethical Responsibility
Content must address the ethical implications of AI and robotics, promoting safety and responsible AI practices. Rationale: To instill a strong sense of ethical responsibility in the next generation of AI and robotics practitioners.

## Standards

- Content must be original and source-traceable.
- Code examples must run successfully.
- Robotics concepts must align with ROS2, URDF, and real control systems.
- Agentic AI content must reflect current production practices.
- Citations must point to official documentation or reputable research.
- The tone should be that of a mentor to a student: respectful and direct.

## Structure

- Each chapter must start from a specification.
- Each chapter must include objectives, examples, steps, and a final exercise.
- Every technical module must include:
  - Inputs and outputs
  - Architecture
  - Code
  - Failure modes
  - Safety notes

## Constraints

- The book must have a minimum total length of 20,000–35,000 words.
- There must be at least one working demo (simulation is acceptable).
- All images and figures must include alt text for accessibility.

## Success Criteria

- A student can follow the book's content to produce a working robotics or AI system.
- The book's website deploys to GitHub Pages with no build errors.
- All code provided in the book is reproducible and free of errors or "hallucinations."

## Governance

This Constitution is the foundational document for the project. It supersedes all other practices and guidelines. Amendments to this Constitution require documentation, review, and an approved migration plan for any affected content. All contributions and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
